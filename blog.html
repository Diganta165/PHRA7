        <h3>What is event loop? And how does it work?</h3>
        <p>Event loop is a process to execute the code, collecting and processing events and executing the queued tasks. Event loop works in a cycle where it continually checks whether or not the call stack is empty. And if so then a new function is added from the event queue. And this goes on and on again.</p>
